# ColorStack üé®

**Turn any image into a beautiful, multi-color 3D printable STL file.**

ColorStack is a free, browser-based tool that makes creating stunning color 3D prints easy. Inspired by tools like HueForge, it analyzes the colors in your image and converts them into a 3D model with varying layer heights, allowing you to create physical art by changing filament colors at specific points in your print.
